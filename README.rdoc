== Fake Zillow
This a quick and dirty clone of Zillow. It uses Twitter Bootstrap
for style and the gmaps4rails gem to add maps for the listings. It
follows things up with a custom listing search that can be easily 
added to using further columns on the listings database. It also 
differentiates between agents (who can post, edit and delete listings)
and other users (who can have favorite listings). Further, it has a 
RESTful api to handle automated requests against the database.
